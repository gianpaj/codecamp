## FAQ about Escuela.dev

### Why I'm building this?

After more than ten years working in the tech industry, I thought many students were doing one-on-one classes as mentors in Thinkful, an international online bootcamp.
After moving to Malaga in Spain at the end of 2022, I want to do what I'm passionate about, teaching and helping people to better their lives through education.

## Course FAQ

### How long is the course?

### What is the cost?

### What is the schedule?

### What is the curriculum?

### What is the minimum age?

You could be 15 or 90, as long as you have the passion to learn and the desire to change your life.

Successful students are those who are willing to put in the work and effort to learn.

Example, I tought young adults who wanted to learn how to code but didn't want to do a 4-year computer science degree.

Or maybe you're who want to change your career and better your job opportunities

### Is there a maximum age?

### What is the minimum level of English?

### What is the minimum level of Spanish?

### What is the minimum level of coding?

### Do I get a certificate of completion?

No, but what you get is better! Companies who look for software developers do not care about certificates; they care about projects and looking at your code.

You  will be able to show your portfolio to potential employers and get a job. 

You will have a portfolio on GitHub with several Web projects! They will be able to see and understand better your proficiency level and gage if you might be a fit in their team ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›

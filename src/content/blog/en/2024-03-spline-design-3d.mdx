Spline is a powerful tool for creating 3D scenes and animations. It allows you to design interactive experiences that can be viewed in a web browser or shared with others. See this quick example of a 3D scene created with Spline.

And you can embed it in your website like this:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@splinetool/viewer@1.0.76/build/spline-viewer.js"></script>
<spline-viewer
  loading-anim-type="spinner-small-dark"
  url="https://prod.spline.design/utMisPAF7pli3Zpt/scene.splinecode"
></spline-viewer>
```

<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@splinetool/viewer@1.0.76/build/spline-viewer.js"></script>

<spline-viewer loading-anim-type="spinner-small-dark" url="https://prod.spline.design/utMisPAF7pli3Zpt/scene.splinecode"></spline-viewer>

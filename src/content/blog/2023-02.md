# Como vamos a empezar esta escuela?

## Porque empezar una escuela de codigo?

## What's the goal or motivation for starting this coding school?

First of all I would like to say that I know it's a business. I'm not going to jump on the band wagon of corporations saying we're family, and there is coffee barista making your flat white with almond milk with a splash of cinamon.

Our business is education. We want to help people learn. Unless the government or some other entity wants to give us enough money for each student (?) and our inscentives align, we'll be a for-profit entity.

But there's a balance to everything. We also don't want to become so large that we'll need to go public.
Of course these are early days, and talking about an exit strategy or going IPO is just crazy. But I believe that if you know where you're going from the earliest possible time, you'll get there faster and with fewer distractions.

Ok. So we're not your FAAG company. What are we?

## Who is our ideal student or customer?

Somebody who has an idea of what they want to learn and they're able to commit 10-20 hours per week.
  If you have 6h of in-person classes + 4 hours at home, that will be enough.
  That's the same time commitment as Part-time master degrees (?)
  
  Of course, the more time you put into something, the more you get out.
  
Ok, you can come to class and you can sit down 4 hours per week in front of the computer with a notepad.

### Have you tried a bit of coding? Do you have a periferal interest? Maybe you like graphic design (UX/UI), maybe you like video games, or maybe you'd like to see if you'd want to have a career in Cyber security.

If you are unsure but curious, we have a free webinar for you! We'll go through examples of what those people do in a daily basis, we'll have guests who work in those fields telling what they do, why they like their jobs, and answer any question you might have.

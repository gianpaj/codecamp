(i.e. libraries for the 20th century)

A lot of things have change after the 2020 Coravirus pandemic hit the entire world.

People stayed home. Some tried to learn to make bread. Others struggled with trying to make their kids do their homework and not be bored during their Zoom classes.

While now after the pandemic we can go back to offices and schools, a lot of things have changed. Not only how we work and study but our own expectations of how 'work' and 'study' should look like.

(As this HBR article mentions..)
> _quote goes here_

In the office, the concept of a asynchronous and synchronous communication is more widely known.
Many understand and prefer written communication or short recorded videos to full meetings.
Why? After years of going to the office or working maybe a day a week from home we realised that working from home, at your own phase, managing your own energy, doing things when you're more productive is just better.
Of course the office hasn't disappeared and will not any time soon. My belief is that no matter how realistic Virtual reality (VR) and similar technologies get, there will be always a desire to be with others without anything in between. No lag, no displays or goggles.
There are many great things about VR, from allowing us to swim in the corral leaves? (link) , playing immersive video games never imagined before, and helping us cope with PSD (BBC Youtube Click).

So if technology is not end of .... Why do we have to choose? (gif girl - why not both)

(this is a though experiment)

What if like having a co-working space where you can work remotely from any city in the world like WeWork offices, you can go to a place to study with your pears.

Some might call that a school, or library. But since have you seen public libraries pupping up in cities like WeWork spaces.

Imagine going to a modern library, nicely decorated, high-speed wifi, and everything else you might expect from a tech company office or WeWork space.

We know that your environment is highly important to be able to study, do your homework, research you next job or company.
Low income folks do not have 3 bedrooms at home where they can close the door and focus.
Government should subside a "library-card" to students and low-income folks. Free access to this Co-library or Co-studying space.
Refurbished donated laptops will be available for use.
Free hot coffee and tea will be available for use.
Yes, you can bring it to the desk.

Who is going to pay for it?
I think the tax-payer should at some point.

Is this the best way to "start-up" such idea or project? Going to local government and proposing a big plan. I doubt it.

I haven't thought this for a long time so I would welcome for feedback and discussions around this.

Note: this is a blog and thought exercise for me to write in English and Spanish, and soon Italian too.

One blog post per week initially written in one language about education, the future and probably tech. I'm a software developer by trade after all. "He stares a black screen with text all day" – says my fiancée :smile:

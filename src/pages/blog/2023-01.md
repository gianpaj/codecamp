This is my in-progress blog post.

No page will be built for this post.

To build and publish this post:

- update the frontmatter to `draft: false` or
- remove the `draft` property entirely.

But, this page _will_ be returned by any matching `Astro.glob()` request.

<!-- Syntax highlight some JavaScript code. -->
<Code code={`const foo = 'bar';`} lang="js" />
